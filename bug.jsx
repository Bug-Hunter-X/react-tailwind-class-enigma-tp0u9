I encountered an issue where Tailwind CSS classes weren't being applied correctly in a specific component of my React application.  The HTML elements were rendered, but the styles defined in my Tailwind configuration weren't being reflected.  I checked my `tailwind.config.js` and ensured that the content section includes the correct paths to my component files. I also confirmed that the correct version of Tailwind CSS is installed and that the stylesheet is correctly imported into my application. Despite these checks, certain classes remained ineffective.
