# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying in React Component

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes fail to apply in a React component, even with seemingly correct configuration and imports.  The issue is resolved by ensuring the component's CSS is properly purged during the Tailwind build process. 

## Bug Description

The bug occurs when specific Tailwind classes are not applied to elements within a React component. The classes are correctly defined within the component, but the styles are not reflected in the rendered output.  This is a common issue arising from incorrect purge configuration. This is investigated with a minimal reproducible example. This example is focused on ensuring the correct purging of Tailwind classes during the build process to solve this issue, and focuses on demonstrating how a build error can lead to unexpected behavior in the application.

## Solution

The solution involves verifying that the component's file path is correctly included in the `content` array within your `tailwind.config.js`.  If the path is incorrect or missing, Tailwind's purge process won't include the necessary styles in the final CSS output, resulting in the classes not applying.   Additionally, it's essential to ensure your build process correctly triggers the purge operation.
